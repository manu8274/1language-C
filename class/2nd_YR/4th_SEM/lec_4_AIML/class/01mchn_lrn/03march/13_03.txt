mechine laearning id=s into two types:
    1)supervised learning;
    2)unsupervised learning;
    3)reinforcement learning;

SUPERVISED LEARNING:-
we have a teacher and student ,
we have an adder;
teacher teaches and then student does same then we check is adder if same to find accuracy 
we find the difference bw adder of teacher and student to find accuracy
wwe have dataset fully labeled

UNSUPERVISED LEARNING:-
user /refer learn from the mistakes and solve their mistakes and there are no labels and we have to assume the dataset

REINFORCEMENT LEARNING:-
like learning on leetcode;
we have been forced to increase rank so
used mostly in quantum computing


SUPERVISED LEARNING:-
    1)Regerssion
        a)linear regression: the predicted give into the numerical form like 80%,60%.
        b)logistic/boolean regression: whether YES or NO.eg will take loan or not,eligible or not

LINEAR REGRESSION:-
1)single(simple)
2)multiple

SINGLE LINEAR REGRESSION:-
1)we have to draw a line which is near about to all point in dataset(line which is best fit)
we have formula ==> y=mx+c (where m=slope,c=coercient)
in a single linear regression there is only one independent variable and only one dependent variable.
OR there will be only one input and one output
eg-> CGPA, PACKAGE
       7     8
       7     8
       9     11
       8     7
    as CGPA is indipendent variable so it denoted on X axis and PACKAGE is dependent on CGPA so Y axis
    so PACKAGE = m*CGPA + c
    why we use  c as neccesory;
    as if CGPA / independent var is null so dependent var will be null so it cannot be happen
