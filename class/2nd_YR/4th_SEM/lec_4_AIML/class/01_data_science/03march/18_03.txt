Evaluation Regression Matrix :- 
    work:-
    to make calculate the diff the two points using these methods:-
        MAE - Mean Absolute Error
        tells us the diff bw the point and nearest point on the predicted line (for only y-ordinates)
        FORMULA- (∑ |yx(point y ordinate) - yline(point at perpendicular to px and at predicted line)|)//2
        ADVANTAGE-
            1)it will give the value in the units of dependent variable
            2)it is suitable for outliers

        MSE - Mean Square Error
        we will check the distance between point and perprndicular at prediccted line and the make a square 
        FORMULA- (∑ (yx(point y) - yline(y at perpendicular to px and at predicted line))**2)//2

        DISAVDANTAGES:-
            1)not suitable for outliers
            2)not give the value in unis of dependent variable  

        RMSE - Route Mean Square Error
        ROUTE = MSE**0.5
        ADVANTAGE:-
            1)will calculate the value in the units of dependent variable
        DISAVDANTAGES:-
            1)not suitable for outliers
