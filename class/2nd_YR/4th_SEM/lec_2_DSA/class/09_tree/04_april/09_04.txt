types of binary tree:-
    1)full binary tree:-which has 0 or 2 nodes
    2)compelete binary tree:-compeletely fill nodes ie either 2 children uptill last level while filling from left , ie all nodes are left align
    3)perfect binary tree:-all node have 2 children and all leaf are at same level
    4)balanced binary tree:-height=order of log(n) , height of left subtree-height right subtree is <= 1
        1)AVL tree:-height=order of log(n) , height of left subtree - height right subtree is <= 1
        2)Red-black tree:-height=order of log(n),constraints for red and black nodes
    6)degenerate binary tree:-only one node for every parent

TRAVERSAL:
    1)depth first-first check depth
        1)inorder-(LEFT ROOT RIGHT)
        2)preorder-(ROOT LEFT RIGHT)
        3)postorder-(LEFT RIGHT ROOT)
    2)breadth first-level order traversal

    1)inorder-DBEAFCG
    2)preorder-ABDECFG
    3)postorder-DEBFGEA
    4)level order traversal-ABCDEFG
