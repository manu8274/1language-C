if we use class b : public a == means all public members of class a are public in b and all protected are in b as protected
but we cannot use private features
if we choose private b then all except private b will private in c

types of inheritance:
    single level==a ->b
    multi level===a->b->c
    multiple level==multiple base classes(a,b --> c)
    heirerchy level== tree structured inheritance a->b
                                                  |->c
    hybrid inheritance == ore than 1 types of inheritance, eg heirerchal and multiple

if we use same function name using inheritance then the class used to call function will override the base class function
