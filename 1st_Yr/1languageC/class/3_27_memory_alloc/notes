malloc() allocates size of byte and returns pointer to the frst byte of the allocated space.
ptr = (int*) malloc(100 * sizeof(int)); Since the size of int is 4 bytes, this statement will allocate 400 bytes of memory. And, the pointer ptr holds the address of the first byte in the allocated memory.

calloc()  Allocates space for an array of elements,initializes them to zero and then returns a pointer to the memory.
ptr = (float*) calloc(25, sizeof(float));  This statement allocates contiguous space in memory for 25 elements each with the size of the float.

realloc()   Modifies the size of previously allocated space.
