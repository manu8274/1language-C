FIFO
eg queue of person;
operations :-
    1)push  O(1) -enqueue
    2)pop   O(1) -dequeue
    3)front O(1)-return first element

applications:
    1)video processsing
by array:-
but in simple we need O(n) time to perform a dequeue function so we need to make CIRCULAR ARRAYS
then we use modular operation to make the pointer get circular in the array
    so we make front=(front+1)%n
    so we use rear = (rear+1)%n
    if(no dequeue) then front == rear
    if(no enqueue) then rear == front
