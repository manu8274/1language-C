operator overloading 
    for this to be donw two tyes:
    member function,frienf function

    what are rules for operator overloading?
        1.at least one of the operands must be a user defined function
        2.we cannot overload a new operator ie only existing operator(eg +.-,/,*);
        3.there are six opertor that cannot be overloaded (? :,sizeof(),::,member.selector(dot operator),member pointer,casting operator);
