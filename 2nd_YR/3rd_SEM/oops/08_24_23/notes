union 
    all member in union share same memory. eg if we use both char an int so we can get 4 byte for even char .
    why we use union:--
    -->memory efficiency : (optimisation)
    union can help save memory when you need to store down different types of data but only one of them at a time . since memory allocated is determined by largest member. so that can help to waste memory.
    -->type conversion :
    can be used to easily reinterpret the undying memory
